## UI Features - NEUBRUTALISM DESIGN! ðŸŽ¨

### What is Neubrutalism?
A bold, unapologetic design style featuring:
- **Thick Black Borders** (5-8px solid black borders everywhere!)
- **Harsh Drop Shadows** (20px+ offset shadows for depth)
- **Vibrant Flat Colors** (Yellow #FFE951, Red #FF6B6B, Cyan #4ECDC4, Purple #A78BFA, etc.)
- **No Rounded Corners** (or minimal rounding)
- **Bold Typography** (Space Grotesk font, 900 weight, UPPERCASE)
- **Geometric Shapes** (squares, circles, triangles floating in background)

### Our Implementation:
- **Bright Yellow Background** (#FFE951) with floating geometric shapes
- **Brutal Cards**: White cards with 8px black borders and 20px harsh shadows
- **Exciting Animations**:
  - Cards that POP in with bounce effects
  - Icons that WIGGLE and ROTATE
  - Buttons that SLAM when clicked
  - Forms that SLIDE from the side
  - Errors that SHAKE to grab attention
- **Bold Interactions**:
  - Inputs that JUMP when focused (with yellow background)
  - Buttons that transform with shadow changes on hover
  - Cards that rotate on hover
- **Decorative Elements**: Lightning bolts âš¡, fire ðŸ”¥, hearts ðŸ’š, shapes everywhere!
- **Auto-hiding Messages**: Brutal notifications that slide in with rotation
- **Responsive Layout**: Still brutal on all screen sizes!
